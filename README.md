This repository demonstrates a common, yet often difficult-to-debug, error in PHP: silent type juggling.  The script `bug.php` attempts a mathematical operation with an undefined variable, which PHP silently converts to 0, rather than throwing an error. The correct behavior is shown in `bugSolution.php`. This is particularly problematic in larger applications because the error doesn't cause a fatal error.  It produces incorrect results subtly.
